/*
What is meant by hoisted in JS?
In JavaScript, hoisting refers to the built-in behavior of the language through which declarations 
of functions, variables, and classes are moved to the top of their scope â€“ all before code execution. 
In turn, this allows us to use functions, variables, and classes before they are declared.
